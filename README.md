# RandomDrawingContest
 Uses Generics to simulate two different random drawing contests
 
 A generic class and driver program that represents a random drawing of an item out of a box that holds a group of items. This could be used for any number of contest drawings, but here it is used to simulate a drawing of names (Strings) and a drawing of integers.
 
 Once a winner is chosen the entry is removed from the box. There is also a static standalone method in the driver that chooses multiple winners and removes them from the box.
